## Introduction

This repository is intended to be a collection of my C language programming practice. It includes implementations of common algorithms, data structures, and other useful code snippets. The goal is to improve my coding skills in C and provide a useful resource for others learning or using C.

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

*   **`algorithms/`**: This directory contains implementations of various algorithms, such as sorting, searching, graph algorithms, etc.
*   **`data_structures/`**: This directory includes implementations of fundamental data structures like linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and hash tables.
*   **`examples/`**: This directory contains simple example programs that demonstrate basic C language features, such as file I/O, string manipulation, or using libraries.
*   **`utils/`**: Contains utility functions and helper modules that can be used across multiple projects.

## How to Compile and Run

The C code can be compiled using a C compiler such as `gcc` or `clang`.

**General Compilation Instructions:**

1.  Navigate to the directory containing the `.c` file you want to compile using your terminal or command prompt.
2.  Use the following command to compile:
    ```bash
    gcc <filename>.c -o <output_executable>
    ```
    -   Replace `<filename>.c` with the name of your C source file.
    -   Replace `<output_executable>` with the desired name for the executable. For example, you might use `gcc my_program.c -o my_program`.
3.  To run the compiled program, execute:
    ```bash
    ./<output_executable>
    ```
    -  Replace `<output_executable>` with the name you gave the executable in step 2. For instance `./my_program`

**Example Compilation:**

To compile `my_algorithm.c` in `algorithms/` to an executable called `my_algorithm`, the commands are:

```bash
cd algorithms
gcc my_algorithm.c -o my_algorithm
./my_algorithm
